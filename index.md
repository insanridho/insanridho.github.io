My work focuses on **zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs)**, **electric mobility**, and **transport decarbonization**, with practical experience spanning policy development, large-scale fleet procurement, infrastructure programs, and operational transformation.

I currently serve as a **Transport Specialist at World Resources Institute (WRI) Indonesia**, where I lead national work on supply-side regulation for zero-emission vehicles and support collaboration between government, industry, and development partners to accelerate Indonesia’s transition to clean transport.
